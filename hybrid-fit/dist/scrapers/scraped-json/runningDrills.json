The toe walking drill is a simple yet powerful way to activate the small stabilizing muscles in your feet while also strengthening your calves. Incorporating this drill into your warm-up or strength routine can improve foot control, enhance push-off power, and support better running mechanics from the ground up. Watch on YouTube."

This drill activates the tibialis anterior, a key muscle for foot control and stability during running. Regularly practicing heel walking can help improve ankle mobility, reinforce proper foot mechanics, and play an important role in preventing shin splints, a common issue among distance runners logging serious miles.
